## 📦 Generated Dependencies

The tool adds dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` in the standard format:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
    
  # Added by Flutter Package Manager
  flutter_widgets:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/user/flutter_widgets.git
      ref: main
      
  api_client:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/user/api_client.git
      ref: v1.2.0
      
  shared_models:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/org/shared_models.git
      ref: main
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Menu Options Explained

1. **📁 Scan directories** - Search configured directories for Flutter projects
2. **🐙 GitHub repo** - Use GitHub repositories as package source  
3. **⚙️ Configure search** - Configure search paths and settings
4. **📦 Use detected project** - Continue with locally detected project [DEFAULT]
5. **🚀 Express Git update** - Update existing git dependencies
6. **🔄 Check for Flutter-PM updates** - Self-update the tool

### Express Features

- **Express Git Update**: Quickly update all existing git dependencies in your project

- **Smart Recommendations**: AI analysis suggests packages based on your code patterns

### Configuration

Access the configuration menu (option 3) to customize:
- Search directories for project discovery
- Search depth for recursive scanning  
- GitHub integration settings

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Git** (https://git-scm.com/)
- **GitHub CLI** (automatically installed if missing)

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

The Go edition includes built-in performance benchmarking:

```bash
flutter-pm --benchmark
```

### Typical Performance Improvements
- **Project Discovery**: 3-4x faster than shell version
- **GitHub API**: 10-100x faster with caching
- **Git Operations**: 5-20x faster with smart caching
- **Overall Responsiveness**: 30-50% faster UI interactions

## 🔄 Migration from Shell Version

The Go edition maintains **100% behavioral compatibility** with the original shell script while providing significant performance improvements. All menu options, keyboard shortcuts, and workflows remain identical.

### Key Advantages Over Shell Version
- ✅ **Much faster execution** (3-100x improvements)
- ✅ **Better error handling** and recovery
- ✅ **Cross-platform consistency** 
- ✅ **Beautiful progress indicators**
- ✅ **Intelligent caching** for all operations
- ✅ **Self-update capability**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Flutter projects found"**
```bash
# Navigate to your Flutter project first
cd /path/to/your/flutter/project
flutter-pm
```

**GitHub authentication failed**
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login
flutter-pm
```

**Permission denied (Linux/macOS)**
```bash
# Ensure the binary is executable
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/flutter-pm
```

### Manual Installation

If the one-line installer fails, you can install manually:

1. Download the appropriate binary from [Releases](https://github.com/daslaller/GoFlutterGithubPackageManager/releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x flutter-pm`
3. Move to PATH: `mv flutter-pm ~/.local/bin/` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\flutter-pm\` (Windows)
